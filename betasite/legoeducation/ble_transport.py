"""Pluggable BLE transport interface and registry.

End users can supply their own BLE implementation (e.g. non-bleak backend
for unsupported platforms) by either:

1. Setting the environment variable LEGOEDUCATION_BLE_IMPL to
   "package.module:ClassName" before importing the API, OR
2. Calling register_transport(CustomClass) early in application startup.

Custom transport classes MUST subclass BLETransport and implement all
abstract methods. The Worker/background thread will instantiate the
registered transport with a shutdown_callback.

Contract summary (all coroutines run inside the worker thread's asyncio loop):
	scan_devices(timeout: float, filters: dict|None) -> list|None
		Return a list of device objects (backend-defined) or None.
	connect(device, notification_callback, disconnect_callback) -> bool
		Start notifications; call notification_callback(characteristic, data_bytes)
		for each incoming packet. Return True on success.
	send(device, message: bytes) -> None
		Write raw bytes to the connected device.
	device_disconnect(device) -> None
		Disconnect a single device gracefully.
	shutdown_all() -> None
		Disconnect all devices and invoke provided shutdown callback.

Edge cases & expectations:
	- Methods must be resilient to being called with devices that are
	  partially connected or already disconnected (idempotent disconnect).
	- shutdown_all must invoke the shutdown_callback even if no clients remain.
	- Exceptions should be caught internally and logged; raising is treated
	  by Worker as fatal.
