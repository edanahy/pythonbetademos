"""Manages the BLE transport lifecycle (no threads).

Replaces the old ``Worker`` class that spawned a dedicated ``threading.Thread``
with its own asyncio event loop.  The new design calls transport methods
directly as coroutines on the caller's event loop (driven by ``_run_sync``).

Backward-compatible ``Worker`` alias is provided so existing imports continue
to work, but the implementation is fundamentally different.
